Basic Algorithms
Author: Claire Winogrodzki

This repository contains my implementations of algorithms I learned in Data Structures and Algorithms class. 

The graphs folder contains implementations of different graph types in separate java files, while the GraphAlgorithms java file 
contains the corresponding algorithms demonstrated on a directed unweighted graph, including topological sort, depth-first 
traversal, and cycle detection.

The 'sorting' folder contains the algorithms for BubbleSort, SelectionSort, InsertionSort, MergeSort, HeapSort, and QuickSort. 
The driver code is in Sorter.java which implements the generic AbstractSorter class.

The remaining files are kind of self explanatory.
